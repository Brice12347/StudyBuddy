Welcome to StudyBuddy!!

This is an Android app designed to give users the ability to study, learn, and interact
with students from their school. After creating an account, users can select which courses
they are currently enrolled in and they can create study groups for those courses. Within
each study group, users can communicate via a group chat or privately with certain members.
They can also create study sessions and automatically add them to their google calendar. 
Finally, each study group has a shared space where they can upload, view, and download any
course material that has been shared within their study group. Good luck studying!

This app uses the Pixel 2 with API 24. You may run it by opening the app in android studio
and hitting 'run' with the same parameter described above

Thank you for checking out our app, we hope you enjoy!

For the sprint portion of the project, we made new updates to the project including adding
a feature where users can send and view+download files directly from their group chats 
and private messages, we also made some small functionality changes and we improved the 
UI design! We hope you enjoy these changes!
