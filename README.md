This app uses the Pixel 2 with API 24. You may run it by opening the app in android studio and hitting 'run'
 with the same parameter described above (*note these are the same API and AVD as Project 1*)

Thank you for checking out our app, we hope you enjoy!

For the sprint portion of the project, we made new updates to the project including adding a feature
 where users can send and view+download files directly from their group chats and private messages, we
 also made some small functionality changes and we improved the UI design! We hope you enjoy these changes!
